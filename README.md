# New Game Plus

Locks items in the bosses, raids, and slayer collection log until you pick them up off the ground. The purpose is to
allow you to re-do the PvM progression of the game, without having to train skills or collect supplies again.

The plugin removes the ability to wear or use any item that is found in the bosses, raids, or slayer section of the
collection log. It will hide the icon in the bank and remove the ability to interact with the item in the inventory.

The plugin has a panel to manually add/remove unlocked items and to see what items you have unlocked so far.
